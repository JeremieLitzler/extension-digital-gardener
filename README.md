# A very simple but flexible block-site extension for Chrome

**üö®üö®üö® The extension is still in beta mode as long as the v1 isn't released. üö®üö®üö®**

## Why this extension

I used to pay for [BlockSite extension](https://blocksite.co/), but somehow, I was not really using it.

It works great but I couldn't setup time range when I wanted some websites to be disabled.

It allowed time ranges applying to all blocked websites.

## How to use Website Blocker ‚ÅâÔ∏è

1. Download the source code and unzip it in your preferred location.
2. Browse to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).
3. Activate the Developer mode at the top right of the tab.
4. Click `load unpacked` and select the directory where you unzip the source code
5. If the installation completed, click `Details` on the extension
6. Active `Pin to toolbar`
7. Start configuring the website to block

## Features ‚úÖ

A blocking entry is defined with:

- a URL chunk (ex: "youtube" or even "youtube.com")
- a start time (hour:minute)
- an end time (hour:minute)

You can have several entries with the same URL chunk but different time ranges.

You cannot disable the website blocker in the settings while keeping the extension enabled because I feel that it will allow you to cheat. You can still update the time range you're blocking the
