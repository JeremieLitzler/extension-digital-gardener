# A very simple but flexible block-site extension for Chrome

**The extension is still in beta mode as long as the v1 isn't released.**

## Why this extension

I used to pay for BlockSite extension, but somehow, I was not really using it.

It works great but I couldn't setup time range when I wanted some websites to be disabled.

It allowed time ranges applying to all blocked websites.

## How to use Website Blocker

1. Download the source code and unzip it in your preferred location.
2. Browse to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).
3. Activate the Developer mode at the top right of the tab.
4. Click `load unpacked` and select the directory where you unzip the source code
5. If the installation completed, click `Details` on the extension
6. Active `Pin to toolbar`
7. Start configuring the website to block

## Features to add

- [] Export and import configuration from a CSV file
- [] Export and import configuration from a JSON file
- [] Improve popup UI
- [] Warn user about overlapping time ranges for same website
- [] Add a Pomodoro timer to the extension
- [] Allow blocked websites during pomodoro short breaks
- [] Export and import configuration from Google Drive

## Troubleshooting

If your blocked websites aren't blocked, try the following:

1. Reload the extension
2. Reinstall the extension
3. Finally, submit a bug and as many details as possible to reproduce the issue.
